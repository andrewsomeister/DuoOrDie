###Summary:
Our game will be a 2 player first person shooter game. The players will play split screen, and they will work together to complete the levels. At the start of the game, the players will have only one simple weapon. Throughout the course of the game, players will collect increasingly powerful weapons from the environment and from defeated enemies. They will use the weapons to defeat more enemies and accomplish the goal of each level. Since each member of our group is making a separate level, each level will have a uniquely different goal. For example, in one level, the players must navigate and complete a maze. In another level, the players must defeat a hoard of zombie-like enemies. We have various other level ideas in our Vision canvas that will be implemented in our 5 level game. The players will earn points as they reach checkpoints and accomplish goals in each level. As they earn more points, they will be able to unlock upgrades such as new weapons. Therefore, the levels will get increasingly difficult, but the players will have more equipment to handle the new difficulties. Players will take damage from enemies, and if one player dies, they can be revived by the other player using that players points. We will design levels so that it is essential for both players to work together to survive.
